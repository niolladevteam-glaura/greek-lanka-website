We are thrilled to share an important milestone in our journey five years of Greek Lanka Maritime Services. What began as a passionate idea between a few individuals has grown into a trusted name in Sri Lanka’s maritime industry, serving global shipping clients with dedication, transparency, and heart.

## An Evening at Sea – Our Yacht Celebration

**July 19th, 2025 – A Night of Reflection, Unity, and Joy**

To celebrate our 5th anniversary, the majority of our members took a well-deserved break from busy port calls and agency routines. We came together not just to party, but to pause, reflect, and appreciate everything we’ve built as a team.

Our celebration took place aboard Sea Adventures LK's Seagull yacht, off the coast of Colombo a symbolic setting for a company rooted in the sea. The event brought together our core team and close partners who have stood by us since day one.

Laughter, memories, and a few emotional toasts filled the evening as we looked back on our humble beginnings: the sleepless nights, early challenges, and the pride of each successful port call. The celebration wasn’t just about Greek Lanka it was about the people behind the name.

## 5 Years – More Than Just Business

Over the past five years, our growth has gone beyond numbers and services. We have built our foundation on values that continue to guide us:

- **Resilience** through challenges
- **Loyalty** to our clients and team
- **Integrity** in every transaction
- **Passion** for what we do

These are the pillars that have carried us through storms and keep us steady at sea.

## Looking Ahead – The Journey Continues

As we celebrate this milestone, we also look forward to the future. With the launch of GLAURA, our new website, and our ongoing commitment to innovation and quality, Greek Lanka is setting sail into its next chapter with renewed energy and purpose.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all our clients, partners, and especially our team both past and present for being part of this remarkable journey. Without your trust, encouragement, and belief, none of this would have been possible.

Here’s to the next five years and beyond may we continue to serve the maritime world with strength, sincerity, and a smile.
